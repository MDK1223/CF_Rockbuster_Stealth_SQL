# CF_Rockbuster_Stealth_SQL
Data Analytics portfolio project from Career Foundry.
Rockbuster Stealth is a movie rental company planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Project Description and Objectives

- I have been hired as a data analyst by the Rockbuster Stealth BI department to help with the launch strategy for a new online video service. My task is to load all of the companies data into a RDBMS and use SQL to analyze the data and ask any questions stakeholders may have.

- Key questions include:

    Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

    What was the average rental duration for all videos?

    Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

    Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

    Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
